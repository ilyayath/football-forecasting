# Football matches forecasting

## Analyzing and predicting the results of football matches

###The idea: Create a model that analyzes historical data from soccer matches and predicts the probability of winning, drawing, or losing for certain teams.Can be added analysis of player statistics (goals, assists, injuries) or even fan sentiment from social media.

### Development stages:

    Data collection:
        Use a soccer data API (for example SofaScore ).
        Collect historical data about matches (results, team statistics, players' uniforms).
        (Optional) Pair posts from X about teams or players for sentiment analysis.
    Data processing:
        Clean up the data (remove outliers, normalize statistics).
        Feature engineering: Creating features such as “average number of goals over the last 5 matches”, “team's home/away form”.
    Building a model:
        Try classical algorithms (logistic regression, Random Forest) and neural networks (for example, LSTM for time series).
        Evaluate the model by metrics like accuracy, F1-score.
    Deploy:
        Build a web application (Flask/Django) or Telegram bot where the user enters commands and the model produces a forecast.

### Technologies:

    Python (pandas, numpy for data processing).
    Scikit-learn, PyTorch for models.
    BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for parsing.
    Flask/FastAPI for web deployment.
    Docker for containerization.
